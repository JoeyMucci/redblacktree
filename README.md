# Red Black Tree Lesson

Use this website to learn the ins and outs of the Red-Black Tree in order to prepare for your Data Structures Final (or just to learn something new). On this website you can see the rules of a Red-Black Tree carried out in real-time as you interactively build your own Red-Black Tree. If you do not know anything about Red-Black Trees, you can start on the learn page which explains the properties of a Red-Black Tree, why we need it, and ultimately how to understand its implementation.
